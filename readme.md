# free_enterprise

This is a project that will set up the schema, tables, and data for the [FreeEnterprise.Api](https://github.com/Antidale/FreeEnterprise.Api).

Currently, it does not create the database or user, and it does not grant the user the necessary permissions for the schema or tables.

I'm probably forgetting other assumptions, too. This is currently not sufficient for people unfamiliar with setting up a postgres instance to be able to run without additional setup that isn't oulined here.

Requirements:
* Make
* postgres
* psql in your PATH
